This can potentially collide with other `cargo` commands running concurrently, blocking them from running for a certain amount of time. In these cases it is recommended to disable the `rust-analyzer.checkOnSave` configuration and running the `rust-analyzer: Run flycheck` command on-demand instead.","media":{"image":"./icon.png","altText":"rust-analyzer logo"}},{"id":"docs","title":"Visit the docs!","description":"Confused about configurations?
